    <p>Neo-Versailles is a Unity First-Person Horror game collaboration between ArtCenter College of Design and Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I worked on this project as a level designer and systems programmer. I developed our saving and loading system and worked on blocking out the finale level of the game.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our world is set in the world of Neo-Versailles, an alternative version of Versailles, France after the conclusion of the first French Revolution. Neo-Versailles was once hailed as the artistic and technological hub of the world, up until the Great Burning of Neo-Versailles, in which the Art-Breakers under the orders of the monarchy burn the art that dwells in Neo-Versailles. This act results in the escape of Demons of Despair, monstrous demons hidden inside of art, who roam rampant in Neo-Versailles, wreaking havoc and bringing despair to the once lively city. The only ones who can stop them are the order of the Art-Keepers, a secret society of artists dating back to the beginning of time, who devote their lives to the conduct of art exorcism, and are the only ones blessed with the knowledge and training of art-keeping, the act used in order to trap Demons of Despair back into their artistic vessels, turning haunting and terrifying figures into beautiful art.</p>

        <h2 class="is-size-2 subtitle">Level Design</h2>
        <p>For this project, I was brought on the level design team at the start my second semester of working on the game.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At this point, the final level of the game called Night Mare had a first blockout pass done by the level design lead, Simon Smith. My job was to help improve the level. I was given sections of the level to work on starting with this circled area.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The blue sketches on the image show the new direction we workshoped for the area. I was to make the first platform in this area more interesting and lead to a diffent path that would lead the player into a cliffside cave.</p>

      <div class="column">
        <p>This image shows a look at the same area from a vantage point at the beginning of the level. From this vantage point, the player could get a sneak peak of their path through the rest of the level. It was important to us to preserve this sightline and a curved path for the player to see.</p>

        <div class="column">
          <p>Before starting my blockout of this section of the level, I was given notes on the themes and ideas for the level that we wanted to maintain. This level was meant to be a big chase scene where the Demon of Despair chased down the player the entire way through. I was also told that we wanted to create a sense of agoraphobia</p>
          <br>
          <p>My idea was to use this first section I worked on as the first break in chase. In order to create a sense of agoraphobia, I wanted to make safer places for the player that were small and claustrophobic. My thought was that claustrophobic spaces would keep up the tension in the scene, especially if added with sounds of the demon trying to get in, and they could double as safe spaces from the demon to make the player afraid of leaving them. This would make the open spaces of the level scarier and give that agoraphobic feeling.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I created a closed off space for the player to navigate through until they got out and had to continue the chase.</p>

        <div class="column">
          <p>Next, I blocked out the rest of the path from this section to connect with the rest of the level. I removed two other platforms from the original circle area in the first image. We were inspired by the horror movie The Descent(2005). We wanted a cliffside cave that would disorient the player and create a liminal space effect. To do this I placed the cave entrace on the left side of the image. The player would be secretly teleported and exit out of a cave exit in the top right of the photo.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I made a bridge (inspired by the final bridge out of the Mines of Moria from The Lord of The Rings) that connected my closed off building to the cave. A bridge with no railing would add the fear of heights onto that agoraphobia.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="columns is-vcentered">
        <div class="column">
          <p>I blocked out that first enclosed building, which I started to call the Collapsed Building. These are images from my blockout and first prop pass before handing it off to the enviromental artist for this section and collaborating with him.</p>
          <br> 
          <p>The idea for this building was to be a collapsed section of the Versailles Palace that was cut off and brought into the Night Mare. I wanted broken entrace to the building that led directly to a collapsed second floor continuing the feeling of the player descending the level.</p>

        <div class="column">
          <p>Upon entering, the floor is collasped and slanted down as a slope. The player is blocked off from heading left by rubble, but exit of the building is framed for them to see. This way the player has some idea of where they are going.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="columns is-vcentered">
        <div class="column">
          <p>The player is led from where they entered (on the left of the photo) in a hallway under the staircase and around.</p>

        <div class="column">
          <p>From there the player navigates around to the front of the stairs. The stairs are blocked by more rubble and the player has to find another way around. The player has the ability to mantle up certain walls. The blue wall on the right is climbable.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="columns is-vcentered">
        <div class="column">
          <p>After climbing up to the second floor, the player is then able to use their paint abilities to interact with the object in the middle of the staircase rubble (the yellow cube) to create a bridge to the other side and leave the Collapsed Building. </p>
          <br>
          <p>This became a somewhat interesting challenge for the area. I wanted to prevent the player from progressing the building until they interacted with the object. However, they would still have to navigate the bridge afterwards.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I started by using invisible walls that would go away once the bridge was built. This created an issue with the paint ability colliding with the invisible walls. It also did not feel satisfying for the player. It did not make logical sense that the player could not walk over the rubble when the bridge worked just fine. Later on my solution to this problem was to have that rubble on fire. That way the player would be injured if they tried to cross without the bridge.</p>

          <p>And here is from in front of the staircase. On the right side, it shows a candelabra leaned up against the climbable rock. I used these candelabras and other candles throughout the level to show the player where to go.</p>
